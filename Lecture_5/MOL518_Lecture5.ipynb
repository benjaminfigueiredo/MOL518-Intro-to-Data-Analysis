If you have experience using the command line (Terminal on Mac or Command Prompt/PowerShell on Windows), this will feel familiar. If you have only ever navigated files by clicking through Finder (Mac) or File Explorer (Windows), this programmatic approach may feel new, but it is a powerful skill that will save you time when processing large datasets."
